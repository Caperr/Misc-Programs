t# Misc-Programs
Games, mathematical puzzles, and any other programs that didn't fit into another category.

Hack()    
A hacking sim built to teach the user some basic BASH commands. Obviously not including any actual hacking concepts, just reading plaintext files and using SSH in the context of fictional hacking, for fun.
If you fancy a VERY light challenge, try running the game without reading any of the code, and see how far you can get.
You can send an email to your client at any time for tips.  
The game has been written up until level 5 (completion of level 4).  
I started developing this program when I was 15 and, as such, the quality of code is sub-par in my opinion. Looking back at it, I'm particularly frustrated by the use of globals among other things. Still, it's a surprisingly fun game and I might finish it some day.  
  
Dijkstra implementation  
An implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm that I wrote when revising A' level computer science before my degree.  
An example adjacency list and start/end nodes are provided, but the algorithm should work for any.  
  
Merge Sort  
Simple implementation of this standard log-linear sorting algorithm. See the end of the file for example cases, including a random list generator.  
  
Snake  
An early demo showing snake running on pygame. Pygame is a third party that is required to be installed in order to run this program.  
This game was written during my A' level computer science course, for the purpose of python and pygame training. The debug  
messages visibile in the console relate to a countdown before the next "superfood" appears. This feature is not yet functional.  
  
Magic Square  
A magic square is an n by n grid containing all numbers 1 through n*n and no duplicates, where all rows, columns,  
and diagonals individually add up to the same figure. This is an algorithm to solve a magic square of any ODD size.  
Feel free to try with different sizes, it should work up to the limits of... well, your memory capacity.  
  
Number Base Converter  
Provide this program with any number, its base (currently up to 36, using 0-9 and A-Z as symbols), and a target base,  
and the program will convert it for you using base 10 as an intermediary. I believe i even added base one support.  
In the future, I'd like to add support for custom symbol sets.
