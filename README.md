# Misc-Programs
Games, mathematical puzzles, and any other programs that didn't fit into another category.

Hack()    
A hacking sim built to teach the user some basic BASH commands. Obviously not including any actual hacking concepts, just reading plaintext files and using SSH in the context of fictional hacking, for fun.
If you fancy a VERY light challenge, try running the game without reading any of the code, and see how far you can get.
You can send an email to your client at any time for tips.  
The game has been written up until level 5 (completion of level 4).  
I started developing this program when I was 15 and, as such, the quality of code is sub-par in my opinion. Looking back at it, I'm particularly frustrated by the use of globals among other things. Still, it's a surprisingly fun game and I might finish it some day.
